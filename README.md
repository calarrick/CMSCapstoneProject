# CMSCapstoneProject
Java/Spring-based "bespoke" cms with lots of asynchronous RESTful client-server interaction. Oriented toward long-form blogging or 
personal publication with fully responsive website front-end.

Final "capstone" project at The Software Guild. Team: Taylor Richard, Brett Hanson, and I. 
Delivered "0.9" version as of end of Guild cohort, and commits/history here: https://bitbucket.org/calarrick/capstone-project

This repository will contain any future changes or "practice" of my own, as this project represents a pretty
wide-ranging full-stack "sandbox" for me to code against.
